With this app, starter data for a BeLL installer can be built. For a step by step user guide, read on.
How to use Installer/Starter Data Builder App:
a)	Open/run the file "launch-app.bat". It will start the app server and open the following page in firefox browser: http://localhost:3000/prepare-starter-data 
b)	Choose/specify a BeLL server by selecting one of the options from the "Options" dropdown or by typing in the address of the server yourself. Then click the button named "View Data from Chosen BeLL".
c)	After a short wait, symbolised by a spinner below the options dropdown, the page will be populated with courses, resources, and collections data from the identified BeLL server.  
d)	You can select  those courses and resources that you wish to include (as starter data) in the BeLL installer by checking their respective checkboxes. You have to click on a collection name to see its contents displayed right in front of the "All Collections" panel that the collection name/link resides in. A collection's component resources are displayed in the checkbox format too. Select resources from any and as many collections as you wish to. Finally, when you are done selecting your data set, click on the button at the bottom, labeled "Prepare Starter Data", of the page.
e)	The service will prepare data and place it in a specific folder, labeled 'StarterDataLocation', inside the main directory of this (Startup-Data-Builder) very tool. All contents from this folder are to be copied by the user to the folder named 'Starter_Data' inside the Startup-Installation tool. This information will appear on the screen as a prompt if the process completes successfully. However, if the process encounters any errors, the prompt will carry an error message instead.
f)  User should carry out the copying task described in the previous step.

Notes for QA:
 When the BeLL installer, also called Startup-Installation tool, derived after having copied files into it in step (f) above is run on any windows machine and upon encountering the question "Do you wish to include starter data with this install (yes/no):  " posed by the installation script the user replies with "yes", the resulting BeLL app should have the courses and resources that were chosen through the Startup-Data-Builder tool (which is the subject of this README).
